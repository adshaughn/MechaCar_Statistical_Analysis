# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The goal of this analysis was to determine which variables had the greatest impact on a car's fuel efficiency. The results how that both ground clearance and vehicle length have the highest correlative effect on fuel economy.

The slope of this model is not zero, as we are able to fit a trend line to the data with some of the identified variables, indicating a causal relationship.

This model overall has a good level of predictive power, as indicated by the R-squared values of around 70%.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Overall, we're seeing an average variance of 62 pounds per square inch, which is within the required tolerance.

However, when diving deeper to view each lot individually, we can see that Lot 3 has variances of 170 pounds per square inch, which is signficantly outside of the required guidance.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

In your README, create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
